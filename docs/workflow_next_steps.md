# Workflow Alignment TODOs

- Produce the visual flowchart for the inspection → action → closure lifecycle (Inspector submit → Manager review/assign → closure with verification). Circulate for sign-off.
- Schedule on-site shadowing for a live Shipping inspection to validate the mobile-first fail flow and duplicate-action checks.
- Import the current Shipping Smartsheet as the authoritative template for the pilot; confirm item wording/help text matches the floor expectation.
- Kick off Maintenance Pro discovery with Dino (API surface, auth model, webhook/event options) to scope bidirectional work-order sync.
